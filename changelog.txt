created changelog
	text file detailing all the changes commited

created gameMultimediaDoc
	word file detailing various aspects about the game we're creating
	I think this document seeks to answer questions that I have about the game currently, namely:
		What is the actual game concept? What game are we making? Is it a Mario 3D in a Spiritfarer skin? Is it Spiritfarer in a Mario type setting?
		What are the game flow mechanics/what does a typical level look like/what is the typical game loop? Does our protagonist go through obstacles to reach a goal? How open is a level/open world ("hop world" doesn't count)

created levelProtype/world0-2.blend
	blender file prototyping what world0-2 could look like
	
created fileStructure
	text file with example file structures in other game projects
